    <h3>Our History</h3>
    <p>
    The two managing partners of WPD, Mike Boston and Tim Wilkison, first met  in  1990 in Charlotte, North Carolina.  They currently reside there with their families. Mike was the General Manager of Olde Providence Racquet Club, one of the most successful tennis facilities in the US, and Tim was competing on the Association of Tennis  Professionals (ATP) Tour and transitioning into the Senior Professional Tennis Tour.  Both men saw in each other a drive to tackle new projects and a commitment to complete them to the highest level attainable.  Their friendship developed and a new company was formed.  Over the past 10 years, WPD has been involved from the planning/design stage in some of the United States finest master planned communities.  WPD's staff and partners have acquired a deep knowledge in the planning, marketing, financing and construction needed to develop residential communities of the highest standard.  Moreover, the principles of WPD have developed personal relationships with developers and builders of the highest standard from across the globe.  WPD's mission is to team with other like minded partners in "Becoming the World's Finest Developer of Small Communities".  We do that by providing great life experiences for our homeowners, in aesthetically pleasing and environmentally sustainable communities, which are financially successful.  We sincerely hope that you will contact us about the opportunity to become part of our growing family!
